Steps to clone the project in your local PC.
[I presume you have already installed xampp on your Local PC/laptop.]

1. Download the raw Zip file from the "CODE" section (It appears green in color).
2. Extract the contents from the zip file to the following path => C:\xampp\htdocs
3. Start the xampp software and start apache and mySQL server.From the same panel, click on "admin" button of MySQL (PHPmyAdmin server opens).
4. Create a new database named "tasks".
5. Go to import section and import "tasks.sql" file into the new database.
6. Open a preferred browser [google chrome is preferred], and type "localhost/Task_Today"
7. CAUTION : If you may have changed the folder name, type the new folder name instead of Task_Today in the above step.

   And here we are all ready to set new goals for ourselves!!
